# AvlTree-on-python
This is my implementation of avl tree for JetBraions internship

Such data structure stores paires {key, value} in it and allowes to insert/delete/find element in O(log(n)) complexity, whete n is amount of nodes in the tree

Also added function for binary tree pretty-printing and test visualization, credits for it to StackOverflow

Prerequirements:
python 3.x+, 
both .py files in same directory

Tests are stored in Test.py, 
to run them, type python3 Test.py
